/*
 * d3.scale.cyclic()
 *
 * Use this scale to map values onto a cyclic, i.e. repeating range.
 *
 * This happens, for instance, when you wish to create a polar (radial) axis, where your
 * input 'coordinate' value should map onto a 0..360 degrees / 0..2Ï€ radians range.
 * Use cases include microphone sensitivity curves, radar and similar basic polar diagrams,
 * Niquist curves, etc.
 *
 * Other use cases include mapping a timeline onto a time-of-day scale, i.e. a scale where
 * you are only interested in the hour within the day but otherwise want Monday, Tuesday, etc.
 * to overlap, i.e. map onto the same 24 hour range.
 *
 * We support both 'sawtooth' and 'triangle' waveform-based repetition in d3.scale.cyclic():
 * the above use case would all most probably suit the 'sawtooth' cyclic scale, but scales
 * exist which require a 'mirroring' approach to the repetition, i.e. where an input range
 * of 0..1..2..3..4..5..6 would not map onto 0..1..2..3=0..1..2..6=0 (sawtooth) but instead
 * should map onto the 'mirrored' range 0..1..2..3=3..2..1..6=0, thus creating a
 * 'triangular waveform' rather than a 'sawtooth waveform'.
 *
 * Design Considerations
 * ---------------------
 *
 * When considering how to create various polar (radial) graphs and projections, I realized that
 * assuming a unit like 'radians' or 'degrees' would be overly restrictive on the accepted
 * input coordinates / values. (And then you still need to decide wether you wish to only support
 * the highschool math '360 degrees is full circle' or also the '400 degrees is full circle'
 * unit of measure in use in some engineering / carthography settings...)
 *
 * As other 'cycling' plots come to mind, it is essential to provide the most flexible input
 * value mapping / transformation means possible: hence the introduction of the d3.scale.cyclic()
 * scale, which can be used to map other (possibly non-linear) scales onto a repeating range,
 * plus the introduction of the d3.coordsystem group of coordinate system transformation classes.
 *
 * When you wonder why you would want to plot timelines on a radial chart, imagine for example
 * graphs showing room temperature logs on a daily basis, where you plot multiple days onto
 * the same 24 hour circular graph.
 * If you are into (seasonal) climate change analysis, the same type of chart would then sport
 * a 1 year cycle rather than a 24 hour cycle.
 *
 * When you are interested in weekly behaviours, e.g. when investigating stock market factors,
 * you might use a basic cycle of 1 week, while an electronics engineer might want to plot a
 * radial response chart with a radial base of 2F so that odd and even harmonics end up in
 * separate quadrants of the graph.
